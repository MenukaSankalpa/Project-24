# Project-24
An Inventory Management System built with PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XAMPP helps track and manage stock levels, orders, and product details. It allows users to add, update, or remove inventory items, monitor stock, and generate reports, all hosted on a local server with XAMPP for database management and testing.
